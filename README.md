This project assisgnment is to :-

- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and muations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
- Modify the existing authenication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
- Create an Apollo Provider so htat requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
- Deploy the application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.

The URL of the GitHub repository is https://github.com/stellalph/21-MERN-Book-Search-Engine.git and the repository name is 21-MERN-Book-Search-Engine.
